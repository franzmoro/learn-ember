# learn-ember
repo with ember.js tutorials/examples

## Steps
- use [yo ember](http://yoember.com/) tutorial, which includes:
  - pre-requisites & installation
  - creating a basic template
  - using handlebars-syntax + sass-bootstrap on basic template

## Findings
- other content can be inserted via the ```partial``` helper, provided we have an equivalent ```.hbs``` file, e.g. the ```navbar.hbs``` file in the *"templates"* folder, and the following snippet to insert the helper:

```js
 {{partial 'navbar'}} 
```
- new templates can be generated by either:
  - adding a new ```[template_name].hbs``` file in the *"templates"* folder, or
  - running the following CLI command: ```ember generate template [template_name]```
- links to components are added as follows:
  - with a default a tag: ```{{#link-to 'template-name'}}Text for route{{/link-to}}```
  - with a custom tag: ```{{#link-to 'template-name' tagName='li'}}<a href=''>Text for route</a>{{/link-to}}```
- ```{{outlet}}``` will renders a template based on the route determined by the router. Based on the route the corresponding controller and view are used.
